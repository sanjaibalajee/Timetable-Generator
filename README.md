# Timetable-Generator
Web Application for Automatic Timetable generation system using Python

Creating a timetable is an error prone process and takes a lot of time. The current system relies on a lot of manual work required to build or generate a set of timetables, but most often than not there are issues with generating a clash-free and complete timetable. Most academic institutions have resorted to manual generation of their timetables which according to statistics takes much time to complete and this method is not efficient and optimal. This results in students being unable to attend specific courses or having to reschedule their classes / examinations according to the timetable given to them. Therefore, there is a dire need for an application / system distributing the courses properly without needing any students to reschedule their classes. The aim of this project is to develop a simple, easily understandable, efficient and portable application, which could automatically generate a timetable that can be scaled for real world use.
